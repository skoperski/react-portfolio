Welcome to my React portfolio project!

It's an app that I build to demonstrate what I have learned in React.

This app consists of previous projects that I created and I plan on expanding It.

In this project I'm using: react-router-dom, axios, passing props from children to parent,
destructuring props, hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef), proper folder/file structure,
and more will appear in the future.
